Zinnia is ensuring that you own an authentic copy!

Zinnia failed to verify itself as an authentic copy.
If you have legitimately obtained Zinnia, try reinstalling or respringing; if that does not work, please report this as a bug, with some sort of proof-of-purchase.
If you have pirated Zinnia, please buy it, as tweak development is my only source of decent money :(
